# Spelling B33 in React

This project is inspired by (and a direct clone of) the game Spelling Bee, by New York Times Games. I play the game every day ðŸ˜Š

Built for fun!

## Give it a try!

- clone this to a local repository on your machine
  - `git clone https://github.com/bmcglauser/spelling-b33-react`
- enter the directory and install dependencies
  - `cd spelling-b33-react && npm install`
- begin the React client server
  - `npm start`

A browser window should open up to http://localhost:3000/

Enjoy!


- **next steps will be to add a choice of puzzles, and optimize access to dictionary library**
